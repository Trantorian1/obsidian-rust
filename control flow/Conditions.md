> Conditions in Rust are similar to that of programming languages such as C and C++, with however some notable differences regarding clarity and the addition of [[#Pattern Matching]]

## `If` & `else`

> ℹ️ `()` are not compulsory in conditions in Rust.

*syntax:*
```rust
if condition1 {
	// code
} else if conditon2 {
	// code
} else {
	// code
}
```

> ⚠️ Note that `{}` are **compulsory**: it is not possible to omit curly braces even for single-line conditions!
