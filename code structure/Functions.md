> ℹ️ **Functions** in Rust work similarly to in other low-level programming languages such as C and C++, albeit with a more modern and readable syntax.

*syntax:*
```rust
fn function(arg1: type, arg2: type) -> returnType;
```

*ex:*
```rust
fn addup(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
	x + y
}
```

> 🔗 See [[Expressions & Declarations]] for more information on how values are returned in functions.
